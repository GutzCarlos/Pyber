            <h4>Rides, fare and drivers trends</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Looking at the data, it is clear that avarage fares are lower in urban cities at the same time that there are more drivers and rides per city. Lower fares are explained by the increase in competition asociated withe the urbanization.</li>
                <li>Despite the lowere fare, the participation in the total ammout collected is biger in urban cities (62.7%) than any other type of population center, this because urban cities also accoutns for the 68.4% of total rides.</li>
                <li>The proportion of drivers in urban cities is an example of the enourmus competition there is in the market. more than 87% of drivers are located in urban cities, driving down the fare paid by users</li>
